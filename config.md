* current tag prefix: This is the prefix used in new relation tags.
* query relation name: by default (false), the suffix of the tag is a timestamp. If this value is set to true, when you create a relation, the add-on will prompt you to give it a custom suffix to be used in place of a timestamp. Creating relations takes more time this way, but it may be worth the convenience of knowing what a relation represents.
* tag prefixes: the list of word prefixes that will be recognized as relations by the add-on. Note that a new «current tag prefix» will be added automatically.
